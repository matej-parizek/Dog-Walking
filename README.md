# Dog Walking

Dog Walking is an application that tracks human steps while also calculating dog steps based on its size (small, medium, large). The application also allows setting the height, weight, and minimum number of steps for both humans and dogs. Additionally, it provides a list of all dog breeds with detailed information.

## Features

- **Step Counting:** Tracks steps for humans and dogs based on the dog's size.
- **Profile Settings:** Allows setting height, weight, and minimum number of steps for humans and dogs.
- **Breed List:** Displays a list of all dog breeds with details.
- **Breed Details:** Some breeds also have pictures thanks to the use of two APIs (one for breed information and one for fetching images).

## Requirements

- Android 10.0 or newer; if the version is older, step counting will not be possible.
- Internet connection
